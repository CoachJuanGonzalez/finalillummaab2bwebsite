6. Go back to Search Console and click "Verify"

#### **Method B: HTML Meta Tag (Alternative)**

1. Google provides a meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="your-code-here" />
   ```
2. Add this tag to `client/index.html` in the `<head>` section (after line 8)
3. Deploy to Replit/production

### 4. Submit Sitemap

Once verified:

1. Go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
