‚óè COMPLETE PROMPT FOR REPLIT: Fix Mobile Horizontal Scrolling    
   Issue

  CRITICAL ISSUE: On mobile devices, the entire website
  content slides left/right when swiped with finger. This        
  creates a poor user experience and suggests horizontal
  overflow problems.

  PROBLEM: The viewport content is wider than the screen,        
  allowing horizontal scrolling/sliding behavior that should     
  not exist on mobile.

  REQUIRED FIX: Add CSS rules to prevent horizontal overflow     
  and lock content to viewport width.

  LOCATION: client/src/index.css

  ADD THE FOLLOWING CSS at the end of the file (before the       
  closing brace if inside @layer components):

  /* CRITICAL FIX: Prevent horizontal scrolling/sliding on       
  mobile */
  @media (max-width: 767px) {
    /* Lock body and html to viewport */
    body, html {
      overflow-x: hidden !important;
      max-width: 100vw !important;
      position: relative !important;
    }

    /* Constrain all containers to viewport width */
    .container {
      max-width: 100vw !important;
      overflow-x: hidden !important;
      box-sizing: border-box !important;
    }

    /* Fix hero section components */
    .hero-text-overlay,
    .hero-content-width,
    .button-group-hero-optimized {
      max-width: 100% !important;
      width: 100% !important;
      box-sizing: border-box !important;
      overflow-x: hidden !important;
    }

    /* Prevent any element from exceeding viewport */
    * {
      max-width: 100vw !important;
      box-sizing: border-box !important;
    }

    /* Fix potential button overflow */
    button,
    .btn {
      max-width: 100% !important;
      box-sizing: border-box !important;
    }
  }

  EXPECTED RESULT:
  - Mobile content will stay locked to screen width
  - No more left/right sliding when swiping
  - Content remains perfectly contained within viewport
  - Improved mobile user experience

  TESTING:
  - Test on mobile device by swiping left/right on the hero      
  section
  - Verify content stays in place and doesn't slide
  - Confirm no horizontal scrollbar appears
  - Check that all text and buttons remain properly contained    

  This fix will eliminate the horizontal scrolling/sliding       
  behavior you're experiencing.
