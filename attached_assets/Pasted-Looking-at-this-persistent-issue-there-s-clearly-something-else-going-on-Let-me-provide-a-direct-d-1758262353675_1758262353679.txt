Looking at this persistent issue, there's clearly something else going on. Let me provide a direct debugging approach to identify the exact problem:
Direct Debug Approach:
Add this comprehensive debug code to your calculatePriorityScore function to see EXACTLY what's happening:
javascriptconst calculatePriorityScore = () => {
  console.log("=== SCORING DEBUG START ===");
  console.log("1. Raw formData:", formData);
  console.log("2. Government Programs value:", formData.governmentPrograms);
  console.log("3. Province value:", formData.province);
  console.log("4. Readiness value:", formData.readiness);
  
  let score = 0;
  const units = parseInt(formData.unitCount) || 0;
  
  // ... existing scoring logic ...
  
  // Add debug after each scoring section:
  
  // After government programs switch:
  console.log("5. Score after government programs:", score);
  
  // After geography scoring:
  console.log("6. Score after geography:", score);
  
  // Before Explorer cap:
  console.log("7. Score before Explorer cap:", score);
  
  // After Explorer cap:
  if (formData.readiness === 'researching') {
    score = Math.min(score, 25);
    console.log("8. Score after Explorer cap:", score);
  }
  
  console.log("9. FINAL SCORE:", score);
  console.log("=== SCORING DEBUG END ===");
  
  // rest of function...
}
Possible Issues:

The form field might not be named governmentPrograms - it could be something else
The value might not match exactly - "Just learning about options" vs different text
The field might be cleared/reset somewhere before scoring runs

Check Your Form Select Element:
Find your government programs dropdown and verify:
jsx<select name="governmentPrograms" value={formData.governmentPrograms}>
  <option value="Just learning about options">Just learning about options</option>
  <!-- Make sure this EXACT text matches -->
</select>
Alternative Quick Fix:
If debugging shows governmentPrograms is undefined, try this in your scoring function:
javascript// Use the backend field name if frontend field is undefined
const govPrograms = formData.governmentPrograms || formData.government_programs || "";
switch (govPrograms) {
  case "Just learning about options": score += 3; break;
  // ... rest of cases
}
The debug output will show us exactly what's in formData and where the 3 points are being lost. Share what the console shows and we can fix it immediately.
