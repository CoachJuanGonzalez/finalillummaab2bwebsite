Please rename the assessment form throughout the entire website to make it a pure B2B form, removing all "Learning" references. Here     
  are the complete changes needed:

  **1. MAIN FORM TITLE AND SUBTITLE**
  In client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx (around line 1042-1046):

  CHANGE FROM:
  - Title: "Partnership & Learning Assessment"
  - Subtitle: "From learning to building. Find your path in Canada's modular housing revolution."

  CHANGE TO:
  - Title: "Developer Partnership Application"
  - Subtitle: "Start your partnership with Canada's modular housing leader. Tell us about your project."

  **2. REMOVE "learningInterest" FIELD**
  Throughout client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx:
  - Remove the "learningInterest" field from the FormData interface (if it exists)
  - Remove any form questions asking about learning interests
  - Remove learningInterest from form submission payloads

  **3. UPDATE NAVIGATION/HEADER LINKS**
  In client/src/components/header.tsx and client/src/components/sticky-header.tsx:
  - Change any "Assessment" navigation link text to "Partnership Application"
  - Change any "Get Assessed" CTA buttons to "Apply for Partnership"

  **4. UPDATE HERO SECTION CTAs**
  In client/src/components/hero-section.tsx:
  - Update any CTA buttons that reference "assessment" to say "Apply for Partnership" or "Start Application"
  - Update scroll targets to match (e.g., "developer-qualification" or "partnership-application")

  **5. UPDATE FOOTER LINKS**
  In client/src/components/footer.tsx:
  - Change "Assessment" link to "Partnership Application"

  **6. UPDATE ANALYTICS TRACKING**
  In client/src/lib/analytics.ts:
  - Keep function names the same for backend compatibility
  - But update any user-facing text in console logs or event labels

  **7. UPDATE COMPONENT ID/DATA-TESTID**
  Throughout the form component:
  - Keep the component name as "IllummaaAssessmentForm" (for code stability)
  - But update the section ID from "assessment" to "partnership-application"
  - Update data-testid attributes if they reference "assessment"

  **8. UPDATE OTHER COMPONENTS**
  Search all files in client/src/components/ and client/src/pages/ for:
  - "Partnership & Learning"
  - "assessment form"
  - "Get Assessed"
  - "Take Assessment"
  - "learning interest"

  And update to B2B language:
  - "Developer Partnership Application"
  - "partnership application form"
  - "Apply for Partnership"
  - "Start Application"
  - Remove learning references

  **9. KEEP THESE UNCHANGED (Important for backend compatibility):**
  - API endpoint names (keep /api/assessment or similar)
  - Database field names
  - Analytics function names (trackAssessmentStart, etc.)
  - Component file names (assessment-form.tsx)
  - Form data field names in backend payload

  **SUMMARY:**
  This is a content/text change only - updating all user-facing text from "Assessment" and "Learning" language to pure B2B "Partnership    
   Application" language. Backend compatibility maintained by keeping API endpoints, function names, and file names the same.
