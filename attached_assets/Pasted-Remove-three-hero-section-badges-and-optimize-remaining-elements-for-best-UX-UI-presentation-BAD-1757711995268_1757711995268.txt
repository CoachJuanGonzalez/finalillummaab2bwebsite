Remove three hero section badges and optimize remaining elements for best UX/UI presentation.

BADGES TO REMOVE:
- "CSA Certified" 
- "Government Approved"
- "500+ Units Delivered"

CURRENT LAYOUT ISSUE:
After removing these three trust badges, the hero section will have empty space that needs to be optimized for better visual balance and user experience.

UX/UI OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

OPTION 1 - ENHANCED CTA FOCUS (RECOMMENDED):
- Remove all three badges completely
- Increase prominence of existing CTAs:
  * "Qualify for Developer Partnership" (green button)
  * "Watch the Film" (white button)
- Center CTAs with improved spacing
- Add subtle animation or enhanced styling to draw attention
- Create better visual hierarchy focusing on conversion actions

OPTION 2 - STREAMLINED HERO CONTENT:
- Remove badges and optimize vertical spacing
- Improve text readability with better contrast/positioning
- Focus attention on main headline and tagline
- Create cleaner, more minimalist aesthetic
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

OPTION 3 - ADD NEW COMPELLING ELEMENT:
- Replace badges with single powerful statistic
- Example: "Transforming Canada's Housing Future" 
- Or: "72-Hour Assembly ‚Ä¢ 30-40% Cost Savings"
- Keep it concise and impactful

RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION (OPTION 1):
1. Remove all three badge elements completely
2. Reorganize CTA buttons for better visual balance:
   - Maintain horizontal layout on desktop
   - Ensure proper stacking on mobile
   - Increase button prominence with improved styling
   - Add subtle hover effects for interactivity
3. Optimize spacing and alignment:
   - Better center alignment of remaining elements
   - Improved vertical rhythm and spacing
   - Enhanced mobile responsiveness
4. Focus on conversion optimization:
   - Make "Qualify for Developer Partnership" more prominent
   - Ensure clear visual hierarchy directing to primary action

LAYOUT ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED:
- Rebalance hero section spacing after badge removal
- Ensure proper alignment of remaining elements
- Maintain responsive behavior across all devices
- Optimize for conversion rather than just information display
- Create cleaner, more focused user experience
