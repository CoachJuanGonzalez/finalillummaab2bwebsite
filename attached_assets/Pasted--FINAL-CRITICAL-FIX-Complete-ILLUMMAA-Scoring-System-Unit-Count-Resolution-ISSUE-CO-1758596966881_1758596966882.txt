  FINAL CRITICAL FIX: Complete ILLUMMAA Scoring System - Unit    
   Count Resolution

  ISSUE CONFIRMED: Analysis shows 4 of 5 critical scoring        
  issues already resolved. Only unit count mapping needs
  completion to achieve perfect 113→128 score alignment.

  CURRENT STATUS:
  - ✅ Indigenous scoring: FIXED (uses shared utility)
  - ✅ Timeline scoring: FIXED (uses shared utility)
  - ✅ Build Canada logic: FIXED (uses shared utility)
  - ✅ Field name mapping: FIXED (sends budget/timeline
  fields)
  - ❌ Unit count mapping: INCOMPLETE (missing 1,2 unit
  support)

  SINGLE FIX REQUIRED

  File: client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx

  LOCATE line 386 (inside the getRepresentativeUnitValue         
  function):

  FIND this code block:
  const unitMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
    '25': '25',   // 3-49 units range
    '75': '75',   // 50-149 units range
    '200': '200', // 150-299 units range
    '500': '500'  // 300+ units range
  };

  REPLACE with:
  const unitMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
    '1': '1',
    '2': '2',
    '25': '25',   // 3-49 units range
    '75': '75',   // 50-149 units range
    '200': '200', // 150-299 units range
    '500': '500'  // 300+ units range
  };

  VERIFICATION STEPS

  1. Deploy this fix to Replit
  2. Test with original case: 500 units, "Over $50M",
  "Immediate (0-3 months)"
  3. Expected Result: Frontend and backend both show 128
  points
  4. Test Indigenous case: 75 units, Indigenous Community,       
  Short-term timeline
  5. Expected Result: Both systems show consistent scoring       

  TECHNICAL EXPLANATION

  This completes the unit count mapping by adding support for    
   individual home selections (1,2 units) that were missing      
  from the conversion function. All other critical scoring       
  infrastructure is already properly implemented:

  - Frontend uses shared utility (calculatePriorityScore)        
  - Backend uses same shared utility
  - Payload sends correct field names (budget, timeline)
  - All security measures maintained

  EXPECTED OUTCOME

  - ✅ 113→128 discrepancy RESOLVED
  - ✅ All 5 critical scoring issues FIXED
  - ✅ Perfect frontend-backend score alignment
  - ✅ All enterprise security measures preserved

  This 2-line addition completes the comprehensive scoring       
  system fixes and should eliminate all scoring 
  discrepancies.

  Deploy this minimal fix and test immediately. This should      
  finally achieve perfect scoring consistency.
