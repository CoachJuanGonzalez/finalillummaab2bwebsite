Optimize hero section design for better visual proportion, hierarchy, and cross-device beauty while maintaining enterprise B2B focus.

DESIGN ISSUES TO FIX:

TEXT HIERARCHY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Reduce main headline "The Future of Housing Is Here" font size by 15-20% for better proportion
2. Improve spacing relationship between headline and "Your Home, Your Lifestyle" subtitle
3. Create tighter visual connection between text elements with proper line-height and letter-spacing
4. Ensure text hierarchy guides eye flow naturally from headline to CTAs

BUTTON BALANCE OPTIMIZATION:
1. Create clearer visual hierarchy between CTAs:
   - "Qualify for Developer Partnership" (primary action) - maintain prominence
   - "Watch the Film" (secondary action) - reduce visual weight slightly
2. Improve button spacing and alignment for better flow
3. Ensure consistent button proportions and touch targets
4. Add proper visual breathing room around button group

RESPONSIVE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Optimize text scaling for all screen sizes (320px - 1920px+)
- Ensure headline remains readable without overwhelming mobile screens
- Maintain button accessibility on touch devices (44px minimum height)
- Create fluid typography that scales proportionally
- Test visual balance on:
  * Mobile: 375px, 390px, 428px widths
  * Tablet: 768px, 1024px widths  
  * Desktop: 1440px, 1920px+ widths

VISUAL BALANCE ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Improve text overlay integration with architectural background
2. Adjust text positioning to work harmoniously with image composition
3. Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility (4.5:1 minimum)
4. Create better negative space distribution
5. Maintain professional B2B aesthetic over luxury residential feel

TYPOGRAPHY REFINEMENTS:
- Optimize font weights for better hierarchy
- Improve line spacing for enhanced readability
- Ensure consistent font scaling across breakpoints
- Maintain ILL√úMMAA brand typography standards

LAYOUT PROPORTIONS:
- Balance text-to-image ratio for optimal visual impact
- Ensure content doesn't compete with architectural photography
- Create harmonious composition that supports enterprise messaging
- Maintain focus on B2B developer audience rather than luxury residential

CROSS-DEVICE BEAUTY STANDARDS:
- Ensure proportional beauty on all device types
- Maintain visual harmony in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Create smooth transitions between breakpoints
- Test visual appeal on various screen densities and resolutions

CRITICAL WARNINGS:
‚ö†Ô∏è BACKUP: Create full backup before making design changes
‚ö†Ô∏è TEST: Verify changes across all device sizes and orientations
‚ö†Ô∏è MOBILE: Ensure mobile experience remains optimal
‚ö†Ô∏è ACCESSIBILITY: Maintain proper contrast ratios and font sizes
‚ö†Ô∏è BRAND: Preserve ILL√úMMAA brand identity and B2B messaging
‚ö†Ô∏è PERFORMANCE: Ensure design changes don't impact load times
‚ö†Ô∏è RESPONSIVE: Test fluid typography scaling thoroughly
‚ö†Ô∏è USABILITY: Maintain clear call-to-action visibility and accessibility

üö® MANDATORY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED üö®
ASK FOR MY EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before proceeding if ANY of these situations occur:
- Design changes might compromise brand identity
- Text readability could be impacted on any device size
- Button accessibility or functionality might be affected
- Visual hierarchy changes could reduce conversion effectiveness
- Mobile responsiveness could be compromised
- Performance metrics might be negatively impacted
- Any unexpected layout issues arise during implementation

TESTING PROTOCOL:
1. Verify text hierarchy works across all screen sizes
2. Test button proportions and accessibility on touch devices
3. Validate visual balance in multiple orientations
4. Check contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
5. Ensure smooth scaling between breakpoints
6. Confirm B2B messaging remains prominent and professional

GOAL: Create visually balanced, proportionally beautiful hero section that maintains enterprise B2B focus while delivering optimal user experience across all devices and screen sizes.
