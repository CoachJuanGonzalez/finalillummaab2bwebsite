"Proceed with FULL Phase 1 optimization. Since we have:
  - No CRM/GoHighLevel workflows implemented yet - so removing customer_tags, assigned_to, and submission_timestamp from webhook is safe
  - No existing database with production data - adding new columns won't affect anything
  - Development environment only - no risk to production systems

  Please implement ALL Phase 1 changes including:
  1. ‚úÖ Add the 3 missing DB fields (buildCanadaEligible, consentSMS, marketingConsent)
  2. ‚úÖ Remove redundant webhook fields (customer_tags, assigned_to, submission_timestamp)
  3. ‚úÖ Optimize tags to max 12
  4. ‚úÖ Keep priority_level in webhook for now (as specified in Phase 1)
  5. ‚úÖ Keep all function signatures unchanged

  Additional confirmation: We're in pure development mode with no external dependencies, so this is the perfect time to clean up the codebase      
  before any CRM integration."

  üéØ WHY THIS IS THE BEST ANSWER:

  1. No CRM = Maximum Freedom: Since GHL isn't connected yet, you can remove ANY webhook fields without breaking anything
  2. No DB = Clean Slate: Adding columns to a non-existent production database is risk-free
  3. Development Mode = Perfect Timing: This is the ideal time to optimize before going live
  4. Phase 1 is Conservative: Even without dependencies, Phase 1 keeps critical compatibility (like priority_level) to ensure smooth future        
  integration

  üìù WHAT REPLIT WILL DO:

  After your confirmation, Replit will:
  1. Add missing database columns (safe - no data exists)
  2. Clean up webhook payload (safe - no CRM receiving it)
  3. Optimize tags (safe - internal only)
  4. Preserve all function signatures (safe - no breaking changes)

  ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT TO WATCH FOR:

  Even though you have no dependencies, Replit correctly:
  - Keeps priority_level in Phase 1 (smart - avoids internal breaking changes)
  - Doesn't touch function signatures (good - maintains code stability)
  - Preserves security implementations (critical - always needed)

  This is the safest, most thorough optimization you can do at this stage!
