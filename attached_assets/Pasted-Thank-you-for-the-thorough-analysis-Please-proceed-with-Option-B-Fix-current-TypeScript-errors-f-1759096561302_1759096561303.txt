Thank you for the thorough analysis! Please proceed with **Option B: Fix current TypeScript errors first, then implement the prompt      
  step by step**.

  ## âœ… CONFIRMATION: These are INTENTIONAL Breaking Changes

  All the "breaking changes" you identified are actually the desired business requirements:

  ### 1. **TypeScript Errors** - Yes, please fix these first
  These are from the partial implementation. Completing the cleanup will resolve them.

  ### 2. **Database Schema Changes** - INTENTIONAL
  - Removing `priorityLevel` is correct (replaced by response_time)
  - Minimum 10 units is correct (B2B only, <10 redirect to Remax)
  - No existing production data to worry about

  ### 3. **Frontend Changes** - ALL INTENTIONAL
  - âœ… Remove "researching" option completely - This is the main goal
  - âœ… Remove isExplorer state - We don't want educational pathway in B2B form
  - âœ… Minimum 10 units - Redirect smaller projects to Remax.ca

  ### 4. **Backend Integration** - INTENTIONAL
  - Remove deprecated fields (priority_level, assigned_to, customer_tags)
  - Add new fields (ai_priority_score, response_time)
  - GoHighLevel is expecting these changes

  ## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Order:

  1. **First**: Fix the current TypeScript errors (complete tier cleanup)
  2. **Then**: Follow the prompt tasks in order
  3. **Test**: After each major change

  ## âœ… EXPECTED END STATE:

  - NO "Just researching" option anywhere
  - Only 4 readiness options: planning-long, planning-medium, planning-short, immediate
  - Minimum 10 units (B2B only)
  - 3 tiers: Pioneer (10-49), Preferred (50-199), Elite (200+)
  - Clean webhook with new fields

  This is a deliberate pivot to B2B-only focus. The consumer form (consumer-form.tsx) handles residential separately.

  Please proceed with confidence - these aren't bugs, they're features! ðŸš€
