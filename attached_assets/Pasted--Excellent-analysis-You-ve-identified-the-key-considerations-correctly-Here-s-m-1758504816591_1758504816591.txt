  Excellent analysis! You've identified    
   the key considerations correctly.       
  Here's my guidance:

  ‚úÖ Confirmed Approach

  1. File Format Issue - RESOLVED
  - You're correct that SVG is
  essential for web implementation
  - Instruction: Please convert the        
  provided PNG to a clean, optimized       
  SVG format
  - This is standard practice and you      
  have the expertise to create a
  high-quality conversion

  2. Design Intent - CLARIFIED
  - Confirmed: This is a complete logo     
  replacement (both emblem AND text)       
  - Goal: Move from the current
  geometric emblem + separate text to      
  this unified logo design
  - Result: Single cohesive logo
  element replacing the current
  two-part system

  3. Implementation Strategy - APPROVED    
  // REPLACE THIS (current two-part        
  system):
  <div className="flex items-center        
  space-x-3">
    <div className="w-8 h-8">
      <svg><!-- current geometric
  emblem --></svg>
    </div>
    <span
  className="logo-text">ILL√úMMAA</span>    
  </div>

  // WITH THIS (single unified logo):      
  <div className="logo-container">
    <svg><!-- new converted logo
  --></svg>
  </div>

  üé® Design Requirements

  Color Adaptations:
  - Header: Convert to brand green
  (#2C5530)
  - Footer: Convert to white (#FFFFFF)     
  - Method: Use SVG fill attributes for    
   color theming

  Sizing & Layout:
  - Maintain current space allocation      
  but optimize for single logo element     
  - Height: Keep similar visual weight     
  as current logo combination
  - Responsive: Ensure crisp rendering     
  at all screen sizes

  üîß Implementation Approval

  Please proceed with:
  1. ‚úÖ PNG to SVG conversion using        
  best practices
  2. ‚úÖ Color variant creation for both    
   contexts
  3. ‚úÖ Layout optimization for single     
  logo element
  4. ‚úÖ Preserving all accessibility       
  and testing attributes
  5. ‚úÖ Maintaining interactive
  behaviors

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

  - DO optimize the SVG for web
  performance
  - DO test visual hierarchy and
  spacing
  - DO maintain existing data-testid       
  attributes
  - DON'T worry about the format
  conversion - this is standard
  workflow

  You have full approval to proceed        
  with the PNG-to-SVG conversion and       
  implementation. This is exactly the      
  type of professional logo update the     
  website needs. üöÄ
