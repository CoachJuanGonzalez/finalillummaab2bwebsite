 ILL√úMMAA Typography Fix - √ú Character    
   Alignment Correction

  üéØ Critical Brand Consistency Issue      

  The letter "√ú" in "ILL√úMMAA"
  currently has misaligned dots 
  (umlauts) that don't match
  professional typography standards.       
  The dots must be aligned with the        
  vertical strokes of the U letter for     
  proper brand presentation.

  üì∏ Visual Reference

  ‚ùå Current Problem
  (2dotsnotaligned.png):
  - Dots are centered over the U letter    
  - Creates unbalanced, amateur
  appearance
  - Inconsistent with professional
  typography

  ‚úÖ Required Result
  (2dotsaligned.png):
  - Dots aligned with vertical strokes     
  of U
  - Professional, balanced typography      
  - Proper brand presentation

  üö® IMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS

  ‚ùå DO NOT MODIFY:
  - Header/Navigation Logo: Leave the      
  logo image files unchanged
  - Footer Logo: Leave the logo image      
  files unchanged
  - Logo Alt Text: Keep existing alt       
  attributes for logo images

  ‚úÖ ONLY FIX:
  - Text content in HTML/JSX components    
  - Typography in CSS/styling
  - Written instances of "ILL√úMMAA"        
  that are NOT logo images

  üîç Scope: Find and Fix TEXT Instances    
   Only

  Search for TEXT containing "ILL√úMMAA"    
   or "√ú" in:

  1. Headers and Headings (<h1>, <h2>,     
  <h3>, etc.) - TEXT ONLY
  2. Paragraphs (<p> tags) - TEXT ONLY     

  3. Navigation menus - TEXT ONLY (not     
  logo images)
  4. Footer text - TEXT ONLY (not logo     
  images)
  5. Button text - TEXT ONLY
  6. Body content - Any written
  "ILL√úMMAA" references
  7. Meta tags and titles - TEXT ONLY      
  8. Any other text content - NOT
  logo/image files

  üîß Implementation Strategy

  Option 1: CSS Solution (Recommended)     

  Use CSS to control umlaut positioning    
   for text elements:

  /* Apply to text elements ONLY, not      
  logo images */
  .brand-text, h1, h2, h3, p, .nav-text    
   {
    font-feature-settings: "dlig" 1,       
  "liga" 1;
    /* Or use specific font with proper    
   √ú alignment */
  }

  Option 2: Unicode Alternative

  If CSS doesn't work, replace
  problematic "√ú" in TEXT CONTENT ONLY:    
  - Replace √ú with properly aligned        
  Unicode in text elements
  - Use U + combining diaeresis with       
  proper positioning
  - DO NOT modify logo image files

  Option 3: Font Selection

  Choose fonts that have proper √ú
  alignment for TEXT RENDERING:
  - Test current font family for proper    
   umlaut positioning
  - Switch to professional fonts with      
  correct diacritic alignment
  - DO NOT affect logo images

  üìç Key Files to Check (TEXT CONTENT      
  ONLY)

  Primary Locations:

  - Text content in
  client/src/components/*.tsx files        
  - HTML content with "ILL√úMMAA" text      
  (not logo images)
  - CSS content properties containing      
  "√ú"
  - Page titles, meta descriptions,        
  headings
  - Body text, navigation text, footer     
  text

  Search Commands:

  # Find TEXT content containing
  ILL√úMMAA or √ú (exclude image files)      
  grep -r "ILL√úMMAA\|√ú"
  --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"       
  --include="*.html" --include="*.css"     
  . | grep -v "logo\|image\|alt="

  ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS REMINDER

  NEVER MODIFY:
  - Logo image files (PNG, SVG, etc.)
