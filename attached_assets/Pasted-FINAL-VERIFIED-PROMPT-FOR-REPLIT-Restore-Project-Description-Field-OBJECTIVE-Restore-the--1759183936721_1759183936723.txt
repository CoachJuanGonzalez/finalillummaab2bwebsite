FINAL VERIFIED PROMPT FOR REPLIT: Restore Project Description Field

  OBJECTIVE

  Restore the missing Project Description textarea field that was accidentally removed during form reorganization. The field exists in
  backend but is missing from the UI.

  IMPLEMENTATION

  FILE: client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx

  ADD Project Description Field (After line 1326, before the closing </div> of Step 3)

  Find this section:
                    {errors.buildCanadaEligible && (
                      <p className="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1" data-testid="error-buildcanada">
                        {errors.buildCanadaEligible}
                      </p>
                    )}
                  </div>
                </div>
              )}

  Add the Project Description field AFTER the closing </div> of Build Canada field but BEFORE the closing </div> of Step 3:

                  </div>

                  {/* Project Description - Optional field */}
                  <div>
                    <label className="block text-sm text-gray-700 mb-1.5" data-testid="label-project-description">
                      Project Description <span className="text-gray-500 font-normal">(Optional)</span>
                    </label>
                    <textarea
                      name="projectDescription"
                      value={formData.projectDescription || ''}
                      onChange={handleInputChange}
                      rows={4}
                      placeholder="Describe your modular housing project, timeline, special requirements, or any other details..."
                      className={`w-full px-4 py-3 rounded-lg border ${
                        errors.projectDescription ? 'border-red-300 bg-red-50' : 'border-gray-300'
                      } focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-100 transition-all outline-none resize-none bg-white`}      
                      maxLength={1000}
                      data-testid="textarea-project-description"
                    />
                    <div className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">
                      {formData.projectDescription ? formData.projectDescription.length : 0}/1000 characters
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
              )}

  WHY THIS IMPLEMENTATION

  1. Backend Ready: All handlers exist (lines 283-296 for input, line 732 for submission)
  2. Security Protected: Existing handler strips XSS/injection attempts
  3. Visual Consistency: Exact same classes as other form fields
  4. Mobile Responsive: Full width on mobile, character counter visible
  5. Optional Field: Won't block form submission if empty

  WHAT THIS FIXES

  - Users can now describe their project vision
  - Sales team gets valuable context for partnerships
  - Form data structure is complete (was missing UI for existing backend field)

  TESTING CHECKLIST

  ✅ Character counter updates as you type
  ✅ 1000 character limit enforced
  ✅ Field appears in Step 5 review if filled
  ✅ Form submits successfully with or without description
  ✅ XSS attempts are sanitized (try <script>)

  This restores the accidentally removed Project Description field with perfect visual consistency and full security.
