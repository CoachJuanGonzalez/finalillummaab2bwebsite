Thank you for the careful analysis! Please proceed with **Option A: Implement step-by-step with careful testing at each stage**.

  ## ✅ CONFIRMED BUSINESS DECISIONS:

  All the "breaking changes" you identified are INTENTIONAL business requirements:

  1. **YES - Remove Explorer/Starter tiers completely** - We're moving to 3-tier B2B only
  2. **YES - Remove "researching" option** - Educational pathway moves to consumer form
  3. **YES - Auto-redirect <10 units to Remax** - This is the new business model
  4. **YES - Change to 100-point scoring** - Replacing the 150-point system entirely
  5. **YES - Remove priorityLevel field** - Using response_time instead

  ## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:

  Please follow this sequence to minimize disruption:

  ### Step 1: Backup Current State
  - Create backups of: scoring.ts, schema.ts, assessment-form.tsx
  - Note current scoring outputs for comparison

  ### Step 2: Scoring Algorithm First
  - Implement new calculatePriorityScore function
  - Keep old function temporarily as calculatePriorityScoreLegacy
  - Test both in parallel to verify outputs

  ### Step 3: Frontend Updates
  - Add redirect logic for <10 units
  - Update TypeScript types (TierType to 3 tiers only)
  - Fix default states (tier_2_pioneer not tier_0_explorer)
  - Keep analytics tracking intact

  ### Step 4: Schema Updates
  - Remove projectUnitRange, priorityLevel from validation
  - Update minimum units to 10
  - Remove "researching" from readiness enum

  ### Step 5: Backend/Webhook
  - Update webhook payload mapping
  - Add ai_priority_score and response_time fields
  - Remove deprecated fields from GHL payload

  ### Step 6: Cleanup
  - Remove legacy scoring function
  - Remove all Explorer/Starter references
  - Final testing

  ## ⚠️ KNOWN CONFLICTS TO RESOLVE:

  1. **Educational Banner**: Remove it - education moves to consumer form
  2. **5-tier to 3-tier**: This is intentional - we're B2B focused now
  3. **Existing <10 unit data**: Will be historical only, new ones redirect

  ## 🔒 MUST PRESERVE:

  - CSRF protection
  - Input sanitization (DOMPurify)
  - Rate limiting
  - IP tracking
  - Phone validation
  - All existing security measures

  ## ✅ GO AHEAD WITH:
  Implement each step, test after each one, and let me know if you encounter any issues. The end goal is a clean 3-tier B2B system with    
   Remax redirect for residential (<10 units).

  This is a business-driven architectural change, not a bug fix. All "breaking changes" are features.

  This response clearly communicates that:
  1. The breaking changes are intentional
  2. Provides a safe implementation order
  3. Acknowledges what will change
  4. Emphasizes what must be preserved
  5. Gives Replit clear permission to proceed
