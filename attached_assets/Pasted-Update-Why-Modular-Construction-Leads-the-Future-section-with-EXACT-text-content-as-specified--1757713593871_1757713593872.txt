Update "Why Modular Construction Leads the Future" section with EXACT text content as specified.

CURRENT ISSUE:
The text content in the cards doesn't exactly match the provided specifications. Need to replace with precise wording as requested.

EXACT TEXT TO IMPLEMENT:

**Cost Efficiency:** Modular housing is generally more affordable than traditional construction methods, thanks to the ability to mass-produce modules in factories and reduce waste. 30-40% more affordable for the end user.

**Speed of Construction:** Modular homes can be built and installed significantly faster than conventional homes. This is particularly advantageous in regions with urgent housing needs or short construction seasons due to weather conditions.

**Consistency and Quality Control:** Factory-based construction ensures a consistent level of quality and minimizes errors or delays associated with on-site construction.

**Flexibility and Customization:** Modular housing offers diverse designs and scalability that can cater to various consumer preferences and market demands.

**Sustainability:** Modular homes often incorporate sustainable materials and energy-efficient designs, aligning with Canada's push for greener construction practices.
