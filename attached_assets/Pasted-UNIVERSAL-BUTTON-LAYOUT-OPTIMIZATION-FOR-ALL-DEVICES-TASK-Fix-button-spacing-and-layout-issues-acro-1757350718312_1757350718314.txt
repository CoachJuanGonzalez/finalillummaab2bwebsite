UNIVERSAL BUTTON LAYOUT OPTIMIZATION FOR ALL DEVICES
TASK: Fix button spacing and layout issues across ALL device types (iOS, Android, desktop, laptop, iPad) by implementing professional responsive button layout with proper spacing, visual hierarchy, and device-specific optimizations.
⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING ⚠️
BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES: This modification involves changing button layout, spacing, and responsive design across all device types. There is SIGNIFICANT RISK of breaking existing button functionality or navigation.
YOU MUST:

Analyze EVERY proposed change for potential conflicts with existing button behavior
Identify ANY risk to current form navigation and submission functionality
ASK FOR EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before implementing changes that could affect:

Button click handlers and form submission functionality
Responsive design and mobile layouts across all devices
Navigation functionality between form steps
Touch target accessibility on mobile devices
Desktop mouse interaction and hover states



STOP AND REQUEST CONFIRMATION IF YOU DETECT ANY RISK TO:

Form navigation and submission functionality
Button touch targets and accessibility across all devices
Mobile responsiveness (iOS, Android, tablets)
Desktop user experience and professional appearance
Existing button styling and interactive behavior

COMPREHENSIVE DEVICE REQUIREMENTS:
Mobile Devices (iOS/Android):

Prevent button overlap and collision
Ensure 48px+ minimum touch targets
Stack buttons vertically for better thumb navigation
Optimize spacing for one-handed use

Tablets (iPad/Android tablets):

Handle both portrait and landscape orientations
Optimize for touch and potential cursor input
Ensure proper spacing in both orientations

Desktop/Laptop:

Professional button spacing and alignment
Proper visual hierarchy and button prominence
Optimize for mouse interaction and keyboard navigation
Maintain enterprise-level visual appearance
