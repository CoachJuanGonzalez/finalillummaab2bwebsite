Modify model detail pages to ensure proper scroll-to-top navigation and center the "Back to Models" button for optimal UX/UI across all devices.

TWO MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED:

MODIFICATION 1: UNIVERSAL SCROLL-TO-TOP ON PAGE LOAD
When "View Details" buttons are clicked and model pages load, ensure the page displays from the top across ALL devices:

CROSS-DEVICE IMPLEMENTATION:
- Add scrollTo(0, 0) with fallback methods for maximum compatibility
- Use useEffect hook: useEffect(() => { 
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
    document.documentElement.scrollTop = 0;
    document.body.scrollTop = 0;
  }, []);
- Include setTimeout fallback for slow-loading devices: setTimeout(() => window.scrollTo(0, 0), 100)
- Test on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop browsers, and tablet orientations

MODIFICATION 2: CENTER "BACK TO MODELS" BUTTON AND REMOVE DEVELOPER RELATIONS
Update button layout for optimal UX/UI positioning:

BUTTON CHANGES:
- Remove "Contact Developer Relations" button completely
- Center the remaining "Back to Models" button horizontally on the page
- Use CSS centering: display: flex; justify-content: center; or text-align: center
- Maintain proper vertical spacing above and below the button

RESPONSIVE CENTERING REQUIREMENTS:
- Center button on all screen sizes: mobile (375px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
- Ensure 44px minimum height for touch accessibility
- Add proper margins: minimum 24px vertical spacing, 16px horizontal margins
- Test centered positioning in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Verify button remains accessible and visually balanced

AFFECTED PAGES WITH UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY:
- /models/1br-compact (centered button on all devices)
- /models/2br-family (centered button on all devices)
- /models/3br-executive (centered button on all devices)

COMPREHENSIVE DEVICE TESTING:
- Verify centered button positioning on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Test touch accessibility with centered layout
- Ensure visual balance and proper spacing around centered button
- Confirm consistent centering behavior across all screen sizes

DESIGN CONSISTENCY:
- Maintain ILL√úMMAA UX/UI standards with centered button
- Preserve responsive behavior with improved centering
- Create visually balanced layout with single centered navigation button
- Ensure professional appearance across all device types

CRITICAL WARNINGS:
‚ö†Ô∏è BACKUP: Create backup before modifying model pages
‚ö†Ô∏è MOBILE: Test centered button on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
‚ö†Ô∏è TABLET: Test centering in both portrait and landscape orientations
‚ö†Ô∏è DESKTOP: Test centered button across all major desktop browsers
‚ö†Ô∏è CENTERING: Verify button remains perfectly centered on all screen sizes
‚ö†Ô∏è TOUCH: Maintain accessibility standards with centered positioning

üö® MANDATORY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED üö®
ASK FOR MY EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before proceeding if ANY issues are detected with:
- Scroll-to-top implementation on any device type
- Button centering or layout changes affecting any screen size
- Navigation functionality with new centered positioning
- Visual balance or spacing with centered button design

GOAL: Ensure all model detail pages load at the top when accessed via "View Details" buttons and display a perfectly centered "Back to Models" button that provides optimal UX/UI experience across every device type and screen size.
