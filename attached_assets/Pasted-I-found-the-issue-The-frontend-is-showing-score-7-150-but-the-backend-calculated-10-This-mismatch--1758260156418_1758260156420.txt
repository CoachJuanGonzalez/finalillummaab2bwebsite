I found the issue! The frontend is showing score 7/150 but the backend calculated 10. This mismatch is happening because the frontend and backend are calculating the Explorer tier cap differently.
The Problem:
Looking at your submission data:

readiness is "researching" (Explorer tier)
Frontend shows: 7 points
Backend shows: 10 points

The issue is that the frontend is applying the Explorer cap (25 points max) BEFORE calculating certain bonuses, while the backend might be applying it differently.
The Solution:
Fix in Frontend (assessment-form.tsx):
Find the calculatePriorityScore function and ensure the Explorer cap is applied at the VERY END, just before setting the final score:
javascriptconst calculatePriorityScore = () => {
  let score = 0;
  const units = Math.max(0, Math.min(parseInt(formData.unitCount) || 0, 10000));
  
  const currentTier = determineCustomerTier(formData.unitCount || '0', formData.readiness || '');
  setCustomerTier(currentTier);
  
  // ... all scoring logic ...
  
  // MOVE THE EXPLORER CAP TO THE VERY END
  // Remove it from wherever it currently is and put it here:
  
  // Apply Explorer cap LAST
  if (formData.readiness === 'researching') {
    score = Math.min(score, 25);
  }
  
  const finalScore = Math.min(Math.max(0, Math.round(score)), 150);
  setPriorityScore(finalScore);
  
  // ... rest of function
};
Fix in Backend (storage.ts):
Similarly, ensure the Explorer cap is applied at the very end:
typescriptexport function calculatePriorityScore(data: AssessmentFormData): number {
  let score = 0;
  
  // ... all scoring logic ...
  
  // Apply Explorer cap LAST (before final return)
  const readiness = String(data.readiness || data.readinessToBuy || "");
  if (readiness === 'researching') {
    score = Math.min(score, 25);
  }
  
  return Math.min(Math.max(0, Math.round(score)), 150);
}
Why This Is Happening:
Your test case:

Province: Alberta (7 points)
Government Programs: "Just learning about options" (3 points)
Total: 10 points

The backend correctly calculated 10 points, but the frontend is showing 7, suggesting it's not adding the government programs points for Explorers.
Quick Fix:
Check if your frontend has a condition that's preventing government program points from being added for researchers. The scoring should be:

Calculate ALL points normally
THEN apply the 25-point cap if it's an Explorer

This ensures Explorers can still score up to 25 points from any combination of factors.
