Remove statistics section and replace with educational value proposition content, updating section heading for content alignment.

ELEMENTS TO REMOVE:
1. Statistics row: "500+ Units Delivered", "12 Provinces", "99% On-Time Completion"
2. Developer placeholder boxes: "Developer A", "Developer B", "Developer C", "Developer D"
3. Current testimonial quote: "ILL√úMMAA delivered 150 units on time and 15% under budget..."

SECTION HEADING UPDATE:
CHANGE FROM: "Trusted by Leading Developers Across Canada"
CHANGE TO: "Why Modular Construction Leads the Future" 
(Alternative: "The Modular Advantage" or "Industrial Precision Meets Innovation")

CONTENT TO ADD:
Replace with structured value proposition section using this content:

**Cost Efficiency:** Modular housing is generally more affordable than traditional construction methods, thanks to the ability to mass-produce modules in factories and reduce waste. 30-40% more affordable for the end user.

**Speed of Construction:** Modular homes can be built and installed significantly faster than conventional homes. This is particularly advantageous in regions with urgent housing needs or short construction seasons due to weather conditions.

**Consistency and Quality Control:** Factory-based construction ensures a consistent level of quality and minimizes errors or delays associated with on-site construction.

**Flexibility and Customization:** Modular housing offers diverse designs and scalability that can cater to various consumer preferences and market demands.

**Sustainability:** Modular homes often incorporate sustainable materials and energy-efficient designs, aligning with Canada's push for greener construction practices.

UX/UI DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS:

**LAYOUT APPROACH - PROFESSIONAL GRID:**
- 2-column layout on desktop (2-3 points per column)
- Single column on mobile with proper spacing
- Clean cards with subtle shadows matching ILL√úMMAA design
- Consistent with existing "Why ILL√úMMAA" section styling

**VISUAL HIERARCHY:**
- Updated section heading that matches educational content
- Bold titles for each value point
- Clean body text with proper line spacing
- Icon integration for each value point (optional but recommended)
- Consistent spacing between cards

**DESIGN CONSISTENCY:**
- Match existing section styling and color scheme
- Use ILL√úMMAA green (#2C5530) for accent elements
- Maintain professional B2B aesthetic
- Ensure proper responsive behavior
