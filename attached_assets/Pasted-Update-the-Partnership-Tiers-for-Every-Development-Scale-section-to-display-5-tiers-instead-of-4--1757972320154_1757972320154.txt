Update the "Partnership Tiers for Every Development Scale" section to display 5 tiers instead of 4, adding an Explorer tier while maintaining the EXACT current ILLÜMMAA website design system.
CURRENT ISSUE:
The partnership section currently shows 4 tiers in cards. Add a 5th "Explorer" tier for education-only leads using IDENTICAL card styling, spacing, shadows, and animations as existing tiers.
TIER STRUCTURE UPDATE REQUIRED:
NEW 5-TIER CONFIGURATION:

Explorer (NEW): 0 units - Just learning
Starter: 1-49 units (update from current)
Pioneer: 50-149 units (keep as is)
Preferred: 150-299 units (keep as is)
Elite: 300+ units (keep as is)

DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION:
CRITICAL: Use EXACT same card component structure as current 4 tiers. DO NOT create a separate section or different styling.
Desktop Layout: Display 5 cards in a row (adjust card widths from 25% to 20%)
Tablet Layout: Display 3-2 grid or 2-2-1 grid
Mobile Layout: Keep current stacked cards
Explorer Card Styling:

Use SAME card structure as other tiers
Keep SAME shadow, border-radius, padding, fonts
Badge background: #EDF2F7 (light gray)
Badge text: #4A5568 (dark gray for contrast)
Card accent color: #E2E8F0 (subtle gray)
Icon: 🔍 or 📚 (learning icon)
Add "FREE LEARNING" badge similar to "Most Popular" badge style

Color Harmony (Light to Dark progression):

Explorer: Light Gray (#EDF2F7)
Starter: Green (keep current)
Pioneer: Blue (keep current)
Preferred: Purple (keep current)
Elite: Gold (keep current)

ADD DISCLAIMER:
Below all tier cards, add centered text:
"*Partnership support levels based on project complexity and current volume. Urgent projects receive priority attention across all tiers."
BACKEND UPDATE ONLY:
In form processing logic, update tier determination:
javascriptfunction determineCustomerTier(units, readiness) {
    if (readiness === 'researching' || units === 0) return 'tier_0_explorer';
    if (units <= 49) return 'tier_1_starter';
    if (units <= 149) return 'tier_2_pioneer';
    if (units <= 299) return 'tier_3_preferred';
    return 'tier_4_elite';
}
CRITICAL WARNINGS:
⚠️ DESIGN SYSTEM: Use EXACT current card components - do not create new styles
⚠️ BENEFITS FORMAT: Keep checkmark list format identical to current design
⚠️ LAYOUT: Adjust grid to accommodate 5 cards instead of 4
⚠️ NO TIME COMMITMENTS: Remove ALL hour/day response promises
⚠️ LINKS: ALL buttons go to Partner Qualification Assessment
⚠️ COLOR HARMONY: Explorer gray must not conflict with other tier colors
⚠️ CONSISTENCY: Explorer must look like it belongs with other tiers
🚨 MANDATORY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED 🚨
ASK FOR MY EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before proceeding if:

Current design system would be altered
5 cards don't fit properly on desktop
Any response times remain in code
Buttons don't link correctly
Explorer looks disconnected from other tiers
Benefit lists don't use checkmark format

GOAL: Add Explorer as the 5th tier using identical design language as current 4 tiers, creating seamless visual progression from education (gray) to enterprise partnership (gold) while maintaining professional ILLÜMMAA brand consistency.
