SERVER-SIDE WEBHOOK PAYLOAD UPDATE
TASK: Update the B2B webhook payload in the server to use the corrected field names for modular construction business.
⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING ⚠️
BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES: This modification involves changing webhook payload structure sent to GoHighLevel. There is RISK of breaking CRM integration.
YOU MUST:

Identify the server-side webhook creation function (likely in server/routes.ts or server/storage.ts)
ASK FOR EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before changing webhook field names
Ensure GoHighLevel workflow can handle both old and new field names during transition

MODIFY server webhook payload creation:
UPDATE the B2B webhook payload structure:
typescript// FIND and UPDATE the webhook payload creation
const webhookPayload = {
  // Contact fields (unchanged)
  first_name: sanitizeInput(formData.firstName),
  last_name: sanitizeInput(formData.lastName),
  email: sanitizeInput(formData.email),
  phone: formatCanadianPhone(formData.phone),
  company: sanitizeInput(formData.company),
  source: "ILLUMMAA Website",
  
  // CHANGE these field names:
  project_unit_count: parseInt(formData.projectUnitCount),
  project_budget_range: formData.projectBudgetRange,    // WAS: budget_range_cad
  delivery_timeline: formData.deliveryTimeline,         // WAS: decision_timeline
  construction_province: formData.constructionProvince,
  developer_type: formData.developerType,
  government_programs: formData.governmentPrograms,
  project_description: sanitizeInput(formData.projectDescription),
  ai_priority_score: priorityData.score,
  lead_source_details: "ILLUMMAA Website - Advanced Multi-Step Form",
  submission_timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  assigned_to: priorityData.assignedTo,
  response_time: priorityData.responseTime,
  priority_level: priorityData.priorityLevel
};
This server-side change will ensure the JSON payload sent to GoHighLevel uses the correct field names that match your updated custom fields in the CRM.
The webhook integration will then properly map to the updated GoHighLevel custom fields we configured earlier.
