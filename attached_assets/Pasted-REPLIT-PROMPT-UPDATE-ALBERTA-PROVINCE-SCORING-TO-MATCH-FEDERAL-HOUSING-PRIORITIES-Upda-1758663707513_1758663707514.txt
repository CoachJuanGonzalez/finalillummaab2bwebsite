REPLIT PROMPT: UPDATE ALBERTA PROVINCE SCORING TO MATCH     
  FEDERAL HOUSING PRIORITIES

  Update the province scoring system to align Alberta with       
  Ontario and British Columbia based on recent federal
  housing agency priorities and government announcements
  regarding provincial housing development focus.

  PROBLEM: Alberta currently receives 8 points while Ontario     
  and British Columbia receive 10 points, but recent federal     
  housing priorities treat these three provinces with equal      
  importance for modular housing development.

  BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:
  - Federal housing agency identifies Alberta as a priority      
  province alongside ON/BC
  - Population growth and housing demand crisis in Alberta       
  matches ON/BC levels
  - Government infrastructure investment priorities include      
  Alberta as top-tier
  - Ensures fair scoring for Alberta-based developers and        
  projects

  FILE TO MODIFY: shared/utils/scoring.ts

  FIND lines 152-156 (Province scoring section):
  ```typescript
  // 6. PROVINCE/TERRITORY (10 points max)
  switch (province) {
    case "Ontario":
    case "British Columbia": provinceScore = 10; score += 10;    
   break;
    case "Alberta":
    case "Quebec": provinceScore = 8; score += 8; break;

  REPLACE with:
  // 6. PROVINCE/TERRITORY (10 points max)
  switch (province) {
    case "Ontario":
    case "British Columbia":
    case "Alberta": provinceScore = 10; score += 10; break;      
  // Alberta elevated to top tier
    case "Quebec": provinceScore = 8; score += 8; break;

  IMPACT:
  ✅ Alberta projects get +2 points (8→10), matching ON/BC       
  ✅ Better alignment with federal housing agency priorities     
  ✅ Fair scoring for Alberta developers
  ✅ Maintains existing scoring for all other provinces
  ✅ No impact on customer tier determination
  ✅ No impact on other scoring categories

  PROVINCES AFTER UPDATE:
  - Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta: 10 points (Top
  Priority)
  - Quebec: 8 points
  - NS, NB, MB, SK: 6 points
  - NL, PE: 4 points
  - NT, NU, YT: 8 points

  BUSINESS ALIGNMENT: This change reflects current federal       
  housing policy priorities and ensures Alberta-based modular    
   housing projects receive appropriate scoring relative to      
  their strategic importance in Canada's housing development     
  goals.

  RESULT: More accurate and fair provincial scoring that
  aligns with government housing priorities while maintaining    
   the existing scoring framework.
