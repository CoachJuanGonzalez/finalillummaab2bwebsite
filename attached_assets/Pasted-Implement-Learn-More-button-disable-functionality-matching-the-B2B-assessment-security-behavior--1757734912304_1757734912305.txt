Implement "Learn More" button disable functionality matching the B2B assessment security behavior.

SECURITY REQUIREMENT:
After consumer form is accessed once, disable "Learn More" button to prevent multiple form submissions per session, matching existing B2B assessment form security.

IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:
1. Track when "Learn More" button has been clicked in session
2. Disable "Learn More" button after first click
3. Prevent reopening consumer form until page reload
4. Add visual indication that button is disabled
5. Match existing assessment form disable behavior exactly

BUTTON STATE MANAGEMENT:
- Initial state: "Learn More" button active and clickable
- After first click: Button becomes disabled/inactive
- Visual feedback: Gray out button or show "completed" state
- Tooltip/message: "Form already submitted - please reload page for new submission"
- Prevent modal reopening until page refresh

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- Match identical behavior to B2B assessment form disable functionality
- Use same visual styling for disabled state
- Implement same session tracking mechanism
- Ensure consistent security across all forms

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Add session state tracking for consumer form usage
- Implement button disable logic after first click
- Apply appropriate CSS styling for disabled state
- Prevent modal reopening functionality
- Clear state only on page reload
