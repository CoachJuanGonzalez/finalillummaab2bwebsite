CUSTOM FIELD NAME UPDATES FOR MODULAR CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS
TASK: Update all form field names and labels throughout the ILLÜMMAA website to accurately reflect modular construction business terminology and improve user clarity.
⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING ⚠️
BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES: This modification involves changing form field names, labels, and validation throughout the React application. There is SIGNIFICANT RISK of breaking existing form functionality, validation logic, or webhook integrations.
YOU MUST:

Analyze EVERY proposed change for potential conflicts with existing form validation and submission logic
Identify ANY risk to current form state management and React Hook Form integration
ASK FOR EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before implementing changes that could affect:

Form field validation and submission functionality
React Hook Form field names and validation schemas
Webhook payload structure and GoHighLevel integration
Form step navigation and user experience
Priority scoring algorithm calculations



STOP AND REQUEST CONFIRMATION IF YOU DETECT ANY RISK TO:

Current form validation and submission processes
React Hook Form integration and field mapping
GoHighLevel webhook payload compatibility
Priority scoring calculation logic
Form navigation and step progression

BUSINESS RATIONALE:
The current field names don't accurately reflect the modular construction business model. Users need clarity about delivery timelines (not decision timelines) and project budgets for modular construction.
MODIFY client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx:
UPDATE FORM FIELD NAMES AND LABELS:
typescript// CHANGE 1: Budget Range Field Label
// FROM: "Budget Range (CAD)"
// TO: "Project Budget Range (CAD)"
<Label htmlFor="projectBudgetRange">Project Budget Range (CAD) *</Label>

// CHANGE 2: Timeline Field - Complete Rename
// FROM: "Decision Timeline" 
// TO: "Delivery Timeline"
<Label htmlFor="deliveryTimeline">Delivery Timeline *</Label>

// CHANGE 3: Timeline Field Description/Helper Text
// FROM: "When will you make your final decision?"
// TO: "When do you need the modular units completed and delivered?"

// CHANGE 4: Timeline Dropdown Options (keep same values, update context)
<SelectItem value="Immediate (0-3 months)">Immediate delivery (0-3 months)</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="Short-term (3-6 months)">Short-term delivery (3-6 months)</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="Medium-term (6-12 months)">Medium-term delivery (6-12 months)</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="Long-term (12+ months)">Long-term delivery (12+ months)</SelectItem>

// CHANGE 5: Construction Province Field Enhancement
// FROM: "Construction Province"
// TO: "Installation Province" 
<Label htmlFor="constructionProvince">Installation Province *</Label>
// Helper text: "Province/territory where modular units will be installed"

// CHANGE 6: Step 3 Heading Update
// FROM: "Timeline & Location"
// TO: "Delivery Schedule & Location"
<h2>Delivery Schedule & Location</h2>
UPDATE PRIORITY SCORING DISPLAY:
typescript// Update priority score messaging to reflect delivery urgency
// Change references from "decision timeline" to "delivery timeline"
const getTimelineText = (timeline) => {
  const timelineMap = {
    "Immediate (0-3 months)": "immediate delivery needs",
    "Short-term (3-6 months)": "short-term delivery requirements", 
    "Medium-term (6-12 months)": "medium-term delivery schedule",
    "Long-term (12+ months)": "long-term delivery planning"
  };
  return timelineMap[timeline] || timeline;
};
UPDATE FORM VALIDATION MESSAGES:
typescript// Update validation error messages to use new terminology
const validationMessages = {
  projectBudgetRange: "Project budget range is required for modular construction planning",
  deliveryTimeline: "Delivery timeline is required for production scheduling",
  constructionProvince: "Installation province is required for building code compliance"
};
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Maintain ALL existing form field internal names for React Hook Form compatibility
Preserve ALL existing validation logic and rules
Keep ALL existing webhook payload field names unchanged
Ensure priority scoring algorithm continues using correct field references
Maintain form step navigation and progression logic
Preserve mobile optimization and responsive design

BUSINESS TERMINOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS:

Project Budget Range - Clarifies this is total modular construction budget
Delivery Timeline - Focuses on when units need to be completed/delivered
Installation Province - Emphasizes where modular units will be installed
Delivery Schedule - Better reflects production and delivery planning

MANDATORY VERIFICATION AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:

Test all form steps navigate correctly with updated labels
Verify form validation works with new field labels
Confirm form submission includes correct data for both B2B and residential pathways
Test priority scoring displays correctly with updated terminology
Ensure webhook payloads continue sending to GoHighLevel successfully

⚠️ FINAL SAFETY CHECK ⚠️
Before proceeding, confirm that updating form field labels and terminology will NOT break any existing form functionality, validation logic, or webhook integrations while improving user clarity for the modular construction business model.
