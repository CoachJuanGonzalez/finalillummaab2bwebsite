TASK: Standardize all form field descriptions to match professional terminology for modular construction business and ensure consistent placement throughout the assessment form.
⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING ⚠️
BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES: This modification involves updating form field descriptions, placeholders, and layout structure. There is RISK of breaking existing form functionality, validation, or mobile responsiveness.
YOU MUST:

ASK FOR EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before implementing changes that could affect:

Form field validation and React Hook Form integration
Mobile responsive design and accessibility
Existing form submission and webhook payload structure
