- housing_interest: selected_dropdown_value (NEW FIELD)
- questions_interests: textarea_content (NEW FIELD)
- residential_pathway: "In-House Service"
- lead_type: "Consumer Information Request Form"

REMAX PARTNERSHIP PATH:
- Direct redirect to external Remax website
- NO GoHighLevel webhook sent
- NO data processing required
- Maintains existing Remax redirect functionality

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - MUST CONFIRM:
ERROR HANDLING VERIFICATION:
- Webhook submission includes try/catch error handling for field rejection

üö® MANDATORY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED üö®
ASK FOR MY EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before proceeding if ANY of these situations occur:
- Any warning condition above is detected
- Website functionality might be broken or impacted
- Webhook endpoints require structural changes
- Remax partnership redirect functionality could be affected
- Error handling is not properly implemented for new custom fields
- Rollback procedures are not ready if GHL integration fails
- Any unexpected errors or conflicts arise during implementation

CONFIRM SPECIFICALLY:
- Error handling is properly implemented for new custom fields
- Rollback procedures are ready if GHL integration fails
- Remax redirect maintains existing functionality (no webhook)
- In-House Service webhook integration is properly configured

DO NOT proceed with changes without my explicit approval if any risks are identified.

IMPLEMENTATION GOAL:
Transform Consumer Information Request flow with clear, exploration-focused language while maintaining existing technical functionality: In-House Service integrates with GHL, Remax Partnership redirects externally.
