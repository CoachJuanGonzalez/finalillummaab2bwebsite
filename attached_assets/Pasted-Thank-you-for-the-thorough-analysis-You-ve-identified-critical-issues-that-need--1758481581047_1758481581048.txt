Thank you for the thorough analysis!     
  You've identified critical issues        
  that need addressing. Here's my 
  guidance:

  âœ… PROCEED WITH OPTION A (Full 
  Implementation)

  The prerequisites you identified are     
  actually intentional requirements        
  that need to be implemented together     
  for the solution to work properly.       

  Confirmation on Critical Issues:

  ðŸš¨ ISSUE #1 - Schema Incompatibility:    
   CONFIRMED INTENTIONAL
  - YES, please add "Indigenous
  Community/Organization" to the schema    
   enum
  - This is essential for Canadian
  government housing projects (as
  documented in ILLUMMAA source
  materials)
  - The schema update is specifically      
  included in the implementation steps     

  ðŸš¨ ISSUE #2 - Directory Structure:       
  CONFIRMED INTENTIONAL
  - YES, please create the
  shared/utils/ directory
  - This establishes the
  single-source-of-truth architecture      
  we need
  - Directory creation is part of the      
  implementation

  ðŸš¨ ISSUE #3 - Algorithm Verification:    
   CONFIRMED MISMATCH EXISTS
  - The frontend and backend algorithms    
   ARE different
  - Frontend includes Indigenous
  Community scoring (20 points),
  backend doesn't
  - This causes UI values to differ        
  from webhook JSON payloads
  - QA testing confirmed this mismatch     
  in production scenarios

  ðŸš¨ ISSUE #4 - Performance: APPROVED      
  WITH OPTIMIZATION
  - Real-time calculation is required      
  for user experience
  - YES, please implement with
  debouncing (suggested: 300ms delay)      
  - Calculate on field change +
  debounced keystroke for text inputs      

  Implementation Order:

  1. Create shared/utils/ directory        
  first
  2. Update schema to include
  Indigenous Community
  3. Implement shared scoring utility      
  4. Update frontend with debounced        
  real-time calculation
  5. Update backend to use shared
  utility
  6. Test all scenarios

  Additional Confirmations:

  - Indigenous Community = highest
  priority tier (20 points) âœ…
  - Maintain existing IP protection        
  logic âœ…
  - Preserve CASL/PIPEDA compliance âœ…     
  - No security risks introduced âœ…        

  Please proceed with the full 
  implementation (Option A). All 
  identified "issues" are actually         
  required features for this solution      
  to work correctly.
