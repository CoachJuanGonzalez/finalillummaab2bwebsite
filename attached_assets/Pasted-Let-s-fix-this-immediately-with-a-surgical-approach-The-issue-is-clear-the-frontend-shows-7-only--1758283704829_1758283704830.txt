Let's fix this immediately with a surgical approach. The issue is clear: the frontend shows 7 (only Alberta points) while backend shows 10 (Alberta 7 + Government 3).
IMMEDIATE FIX - Add This Debug Code:
Open client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx and replace your calculatePriorityScore function with this debug version:
javascriptconst calculatePriorityScore = () => {
  // CRITICAL DEBUG
  console.log("DEBUG - All formData fields:", Object.keys(formData));
  console.log("DEBUG - governmentPrograms value:", formData.governmentPrograms);
  
  let score = 0;
  const units = parseInt(formData.unitCount) || 0;
  
  // ... your existing code until government programs section ...
  
  // REPLACE your government programs switch with this:
  console.log("DEBUG - Before gov programs, score:", score);
  
  // CHECK BOTH POSSIBLE FIELD NAMES
  const govValue = formData.governmentPrograms || formData.government_programs || "";
  console.log("DEBUG - Gov value being checked:", govValue);
  
  switch (govValue) {
    case "Currently participating": 
      score += 30; 
      console.log("DEBUG - Added 30 for Currently participating");
      break;
    case "Very interested": 
      score += 20; 
      console.log("DEBUG - Added 20 for Very interested");
      break;
    case "Somewhat interested": 
      score += 10; 
      console.log("DEBUG - Added 10 for Somewhat interested");
      break;
    case "Just learning about options": 
      score += 3; 
      console.log("DEBUG - Added 3 for Just learning");
      break;
    case "Not interested": 
      score += 0; 
      break;
    default: 
      console.log("DEBUG - NO MATCH for gov programs:", govValue);
      score += 0;
  }
  
  console.log("DEBUG - After gov programs, score:", score);
  
  // Continue with rest of scoring...
Most Likely Issues:

Field name mismatch: The form might be saving as government_programs (underscore) but scoring expects governmentPrograms (camelCase)
Value mismatch: The dropdown value might have extra spaces or different capitalization

Quick Alternative Fix:
If the debug shows the field is missing, add this right after you define let score = 0;:
javascript// FORCE FIELD SYNC
if (!formData.governmentPrograms && formData.government_programs) {
  formData.governmentPrograms = formData.government_programs;
}
Run this, check your browser console (F12), and tell me what the DEBUG lines show. The issue will be immediately obvious from the output.
