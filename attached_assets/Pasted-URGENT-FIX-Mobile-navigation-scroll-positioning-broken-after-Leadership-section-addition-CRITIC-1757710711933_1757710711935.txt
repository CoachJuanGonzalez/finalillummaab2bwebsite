URGENT FIX: Mobile navigation scroll positioning broken after Leadership section addition.

CRITICAL ISSUE:
After adding the Leadership section, mobile hamburger menu navigation doesn't scroll to correct section starting points. All navigation links scroll past the intended section start on mobile devices.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
‚úÖ Desktop/Laptop: Navigation works correctly, scrolls to proper section starts
‚ùå Mobile: All navigation links scroll too far down, missing section beginnings
‚ùå Tablet/iPad: Needs verification and potential fixing

REQUIRED FIX:
1. Investigate mobile scroll offset calculations after Leadership section addition
2. Fix mobile navigation to scroll to exact section starting points
3. Ensure proper scroll positioning across ALL device types
4. Maintain existing desktop/laptop functionality (don't break what works)

DEVICE TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- ‚úÖ Desktop: Verify still works correctly
- ‚úÖ Laptop: Verify still works correctly  
- üîß Mobile phones: Fix scroll positioning to section starts
- üîß iPad/Tablets: Fix scroll positioning to section starts
- üîß All screen sizes: Comprehensive responsive testing

LIKELY CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- Leadership section addition may have affected scroll calculations
- Mobile header height offset calculations might be incorrect
- Sticky header behavior differences between desktop and mobile
- Viewport height calculations for mobile scroll positioning

TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION:
1. Check scroll offset calculations in navigation component
2. Verify mobile header height compensation
3. Review smooth scroll behavior implementation
4. Test section anchor positioning across devices
5. Validate viewport-specific scroll calculations
