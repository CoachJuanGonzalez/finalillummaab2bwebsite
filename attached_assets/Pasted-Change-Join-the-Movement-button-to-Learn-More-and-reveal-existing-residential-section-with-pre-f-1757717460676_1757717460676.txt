BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE:
CHANGE FROM: "Join the Movement" (static button)
CHANGE TO: "Learn More" (reveals existing residential section)

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Change button text from "Join the Movement" to "Learn More"

   - Lead Type: "Consumer Information Request Form"

EXISTING SECTION TO REVEAL:
Show current "Residential Projects (Under 50 Units)" section exactly as shown in image:
- Section header: "Residential Projects (Under 50 Units)"
- Subtitle: "ILLÜMMAA offers two pathways for residential projects:"
- Left card: "In-House First-Time Home Buyer Service" with:
  * Direct consultation with ILLÜMMAA specialists
  * No real estate agents involved
  * For clients preferring direct builder relationship
  * "Choose In-House Service" green button
- Right card: "Remax Partnership Program" with:
  * Full real estate agent support
  * Land acquisition assistance
  * Complete guided home buying process
  * "Choose Remax Partnership" green button

UX/UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Reveal section immediately below "Learn More" button when clicked
- Maintain exact same visual presentation as existing residential pathway
- Use identical form processing and routing logic
- Preserve current mobile responsiveness
- Keep same card styling and button interactions

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Toggle visibility of existing residential section component
- Pre-populate hidden form fields with consumer defaults

- Preserve all existing functionality

GOAL: Identical user experience to current residential pathway, accessed via "Learn More" button instead of assessment form routing.
