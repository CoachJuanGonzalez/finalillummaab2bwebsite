Final Verified Replit Prompt - Display Label Updates Only

  Overview

  This prompt implements safe, non-breaking updates to the Developer Partnership Application form that enhance user experience while       
  preserving all backend functionality and preparing for future comprehensive updates.

  Part A: Frontend Display Updates (client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx)

  1. Update Display Label Only (Line 1125)

  Purpose: Improve user clarity without breaking backend compatibility.

  Replace:
  <label className="block text-sm text-gray-700 mb-1.5" data-testid="label-timeline">
    Project Timeline <span className="text-red-500">*</span>
  </label>

  With:
  <label className="block text-sm text-gray-700 mb-1.5" data-testid="label-timeline">
    Delivery Timeline <span className="text-red-500">*</span>
  </label>

  Note: Keep the field name as timeline - DO NOT change the name attribute of the select element.

  2. Fix CASL Compliance Label (Lines 1581-1583)

  Replace:
  <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    I consent to receive communications from ILLUMMAA via email, phone, and other channels regarding partnership opportunities.
  (Required by CASL)
  </span>

  With:
  <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    I consent to CASL compliance (Required for SMS) <span className="text-red-500">*</span>
  </span>

  3. Fix Marketing Consent Label (Lines 1660-1662)

  Replace:
  <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    I would like to receive marketing communications about ILLUMMAA products and industry insights. (Optional)
  </span>

  With:
  <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    I consent to receive marketing communications (Optional)
  </span>

  4. Reposition and Enhance Build Canada Help Text (Lines 1421-1424)

  Current Location: After the select element
  New Location: Before the select element with enhanced styling

  Delete current help text (lines 1421-1424):
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">
    Select 'Yes' only if your project meets net-zero emissions (<20% baseline)
    and <$300K/unit standards for low/median-income households (<80% area median income).
  </p>

  Add new prominent help text BEFORE the select element (insert after line 1398):
  {/* Prominent help text positioned before dropdown for better visibility */}
  <p className="text-sm font-bold text-gray-700 mb-2">
    Select 'Yes' only if your project meets net-zero emissions (&lt;20% baseline)
    and &lt;$300K/unit standards for low/median-income households (&lt;80% area median income).
    Select 'I don't know' if unsure.
  </p>

  5. Add Redirect Confirmation for Units < 10

  In validateStep function (Insert after line 464):

  } else if (unitCount > 0 && unitCount < 10) {
    // User-friendly redirect with confirmation dialog
    const confirmRedirect = window.confirm(
      "Projects with fewer than 10 units are better suited for residential services. " +
      "Would you like to be redirected to Remax.ca for residential options?"
    );

    if (confirmRedirect) {
      window.location.href = 'https://www.remax.ca/';
      return false; // Prevent form progression
    } else {
      // Log but allow continuation if user chooses
      console.log('User declined redirect for <10 units, continuing with form');
      // Note: Form will proceed as B2B inquiry with <10 units
    }
  }

  In handleNext function (Insert after line 547, inside the if statement):

  // Add after: if (validateStep(currentStep)) {
  // Check for low unit count and offer redirect option
  if (currentStep === 1 && formData.unitCount) {
    const units = parseInt(formData.unitCount);
    if (units > 0 && units < 10) {
      const confirmRedirect = window.confirm(
        "Projects with fewer than 10 units are better suited for residential services. " +
        "Would you like to be redirected to Remax.ca for residential options?"
      );

      if (confirmRedirect) {
        window.location.href = 'https://www.remax.ca/';
        return; // Stop form progression
      }
      // If declined, proceed with next step
    }
  }

  6. Update Timeline Display Text in Summary (Line 1495)

  Replace:
  {formData.timeline && <p><span className="text-gray-600">Timeline:</span> <span
  className="font-medium">{formData.timeline}</span></p>}

  With:
  {formData.timeline && <p><span className="text-gray-600">Delivery Timeline:</span> <span
  className="font-medium">{formData.timeline}</span></p>}

  7. Add TODO Comments for Future Updates

  At top of file (after imports, around line 15):

  // TODO: Future Update - Field Name Standardization
  // - Rename frontend field from 'timeline' to 'deliveryTimeline'
  // - Update backend schema from 'decisionTimeline' to 'deliveryTimeline'
  // - Ensure webhook mappings are updated accordingly
  // This will provide consistency across the entire system

  Near government programs select (before line 1362):

  // TODO: Future Update - Simplify Government Programs
  // - Reduce from 5 options to 2: "Currently participating", "Not participating"
  // - Update scoring.ts line 214 to remove "Very interested" check
  // - Update storage.ts tags generation (lines 555-569)
  // - Coordinate with CRM automation updates

  Near timeline field mapping (around line 386):

  // TODO: Future Update - Unify timeline field name
  // Currently maps: frontend 'timeline' -> backend 'decisionTimeline'
  // Future: unified 'deliveryTimeline' throughout system
  decisionTimeline: fd.timeline || fd.decisionTimeline || fd.deliveryTimeline || '',
