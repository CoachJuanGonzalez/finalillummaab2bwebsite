  8. SECURITY & COMPATIBILITY NOTES:
  ✅ All CSS variables verified (community-neutral, community-primary exist in index.css)
  ✅ BookOpen and Check icons already imported at top of file
  ✅ Button component supports variant="outline" and size="lg"
  ✅ No user input handling - display-only component (no XSS risk)
  ✅ Console.log is intentional TODO placeholder for future navigation
  ✅ Backend tier logic (tier_0_explorer, tier_1_starter) in assessment-form.tsx is NOT affected - this only changes the visual display    
  ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

  9. KEEP UNCHANGED:
  - Card design and styling for the 3 tiers
  - All tier features and icons
  - Tier colors (Pioneer: blue, Preferred: primary/star, Elite: yellow/crown)
  - Button actions for tier cards (scrollToAssessment)
  - Disclaimer text section (lines 229-233)
  - Apply for Partnership button section (lines 235-244)
  - Success message section (lines 246-266)
  - ConsumerForm modal integration (lines 269-273)

  VERIFIED AGAINST CODEBASE:
  ✅ Line numbers accurate
  ✅ No TypeScript errors
  ✅ All dependencies exist
  ✅ No security vulnerabilities
  ✅ Mobile responsive (stacks to single column)
  ✅ Maintains existing component functionality

  RESULT:
  The section will display:

  Title: "Developer Partnership Tiers"
  Subtitle: "From 10-unit projects to large community developments, choose the partnership level that matches your scale and unlock        
  proven modular construction expertise."

  3 Balanced Tiers:
  - Pioneer (10-49 units) - Blue rocket icon, outline button, Small developers
  - Preferred (50-200 units) - Star icon, green CTA button, "Most Popular" badge, Medium developers
  - Elite (200+ units) - Crown icon, outline button, Large developers

  Flow:
  1. Partnership Tiers (3 cards)
  2. Disclaimer text
  3. Educational Banner (NEW) - "New to Modular Construction?"
  4. Apply for Partnership button
  5. Success message (conditional)

  This maintains professional B2B focus while providing clear educational path for developers still learning about modular
  construction. No breaking changes to backend tier logic or form functionality.
