‚úÖ PROCEED - Implement the full universal button 
  optimization system

  Thank you for the thorough audit and professional approach     
  to identifying potential risks. Your analysis demonstrates     
  exactly the kind of careful implementation I expect for        
  enterprise-grade development.

  üéØ Confirmed Implementation Strategy

  PROCEED with all comprehensive changes as outlined in the      
  prompt with this guidance:

  ‚úÖ Approved Changes:

  - Universal CSS rules for ALL button types
  - Text wrapping and overflow prevention across the site        
  - Responsive font sizing with clamp() functions
  - Mobile-specific optimizations for all devices
  - Accessibility compliance (44px minimum touch targets)        

  üîß Implementation Approach:

  1. Apply changes systematically - Component by component       
  2. Test incrementally - Verify each component works before     
  moving to next
  3. Document any visual changes - Note what shifts from
  current design
  4. Maintain brand consistency - Keep colors, hover states,     
  and core styling

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable Trade-offs:

  - Visual appearance changes are acceptable if they improve     
  functionality
  - Layout adjustments are fine as long as buttons remain        
  professional
  - Button sizing changes are expected and welcomed for
  better UX

  üö® Only Stop If:

  - Replit development environment breaks or fails to compile    
  - Critical functionality completely stops working (forms       
  won't submit, navigation breaks)
  - Massive visual degradation that makes site unusable

  üíº Business Priority:

  Text overflow on buttons is damaging our professional 
  credibility and conversion rates. This fix is
  business-critical and takes priority over maintaining
  current visual appearance.

  Proceed with confidence - your professional approach gives     
  me full trust in the implementation. The universal button      
  standards will create a better user experience across all      
  devices.

  Thank you for the excellent audit and careful
  consideration! üöÄ
